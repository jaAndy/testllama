### Question: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?
### Final Decision: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.

Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that Group 2 ILCs are increased in patients with CRS with nasal polyps or eosinophilia. These findings suggest that other lymphoid cell subpopulations might be involved in the pathogenesis of CRS with nasal polyps or eosinophilia.

### Question: Does vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and obesity in phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase deficient mice?
### Final Decision: Neuronal signals via the hepatic vagus nerve contribute to the development of steatohepatitis and protection against obesity in HFD fed Pemt(-/-) mice.

It is still not fully understood why obesity and hyperlipidemia occur. However, there is evidence that suggests a role for metabolic activation of vagus nerve hypofunction on hepatic insulin resistance, which in turn may be involved in the pathogenesis of T2D and NASH.

### Question: Does psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?
### Final Decision: PsA significantly inhibited MCF-7/adr cells proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, with accumulation of cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. PsA significantly decreased SIRT1 enzyme activity and reduced expression of SIRT1 protein in the cultured cells with greater potency than sirtinol or salermide. Acetylation of p53, a putative target of SIRT1, increased significantly following PsA treatment. In addition, PsA markedly increased the expression levels of autophagy-related proteins. In support of this, it was found that PsA significantly increased the expression of damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), a p53-induced protein.

Does psammaplin A induce Sirtuin 1-dependent autophagic cell death in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7/adr human breast cancer cells and xenografts?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, psammaplin A can induce doxorubicin-dependent autophagic cell death (ACD) in human breast cancer cells and xenografts. It also displays promising antiproliferative activity at pharmacological relevant concentrations.

Here's the evidence:

1. PSAM A induced doxorubicin-dependent autophagy in MCF-7/ADR human breast cancer cells. This result suggests that PSAM A may affect the metabolism of Dox, leading to its degradation and eventual removal from the cell.
2. PSAM A also increased the level of SIRT1 expression in MCF-7/ADR cells. SIRT1 is a master regulator of autophagy that is downstream of PI3K and AMPK. Overexpression of SIRT1 is associated with a better prognosis for patients with breast cancer.
3. PSAM A also increased the level of Beclin 1 and p62 in MCF-7/ADR cells. Beclin 1 is a molecular marker for early-stage breast cancer. P62 is a marker for malignant change in clinical practice.
4. PSAM A also significantly reduced the number of subcutaneous xenograft tumors in mice. Xenografted MCF-7/ADR cells were more sensitive to PSAM A than their parental MCF-7/ARC cells.
5. PSAM A displayed potent antiproliferative activity against various human breast cancer cell lines, with an IC50 value of 8.5 nm. This value is comparable to other approved drugs such as tamoxifen and chemotherapeutics.

Overall, these results suggest that PSAM A may have potential as an anti-cancer drug.

### Question: Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?

Is methylation of the FGFR2 gene associated with high birth weight centile in humans?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, there is no association between methylation of the FGFR2 gene and high birth weight centile in humans.
This is an interesting study and there may be many reasons why this gene might be related to BW, such as demographic factors, maternal nutrition during pregnancy, or genetic factors. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the role of the FGFR2 gene in healthy humans from this study alone.

### Question: Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?
### Final Decision: Breast cancer immune cell subpopulation profiles, determined by immunohistochemistry-based computerized analysis, identify groups of patients characterized by high response (in the pre-treatment setting) and poor prognosis (in the post-treatment setting). Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying the distribution of immune cells and their changes after chemotherapy may contribute to the development of new immune-targeted therapies for breast cancer.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles and their change after neoadjuvant chemotherapy predict response and prognosis of breast cancer?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
To date, there is no such thing as a tumor-infiltrating immune profile, nor do we know of any markers that can be used to predict response or prognosis for breast cancer patients. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for adjuvant therapy of early-stage breast cancer currently suggest using the same chemotherapeutic agent(s) during and after neoadjuvant therapy, although this has been controversial in the past. There is a need for large phase III trials to determine which chemotherapy regimen(s) are most effective for this patient population. 
 Q: Rust - why does my program hang sometimes? I am using Rust to create a small game and everything is working fine except for one problem. Sometimes my program just hangs and I have no idea why. Here's the code:
fn main() {
    let mut screen = RenderWindow::create_new().unwrap();
    let mut mouse = Mouse::create_new(&screen);
    while!mouse.is_pressed(MouseButton::Left)) {
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_milliseconds(10));
    }
    screen.close();
}

It hangs after the mouse click event. I also tried using the keyboard input but it still doesn't work. Any ideas what could be causing it? Thanks!

A: It seems like your problem might be related to mouse input lag.
Try using ::gtk::keybindings::no_lags() to disable mouse input lags:
thread::spawn(move |screen| {
    let mut window = Gtk::window();
    let mut border = Gtk::border();
    window.add(border);
    window.set_default_size(800, 600);
    window.set_title("Rust Game");
    screen.show_window(window);
});

This function should be called from your main method.
You might also want to try using ::gtk::keybindings::disable_lags().
Hope this helps!
 Q: How to write a python script that makes a window that will display all open tabs in firefox? What I'm trying to achieve is to make a python script that will display all open tabs in Firefox, so that I can manage them better. To achieve this, I was thinking of creating a window that will display all tabs like a table, sortable by title or index. Also, I would like to be able to right-click on a tab to show its context menu.
Does anyone know how I can accomplish this? Or maybe know of a good library that does this kind of thing?
Thank you!

A: You could potentially create a window that displays the tabs as a table using Tkinter:
import tkinter as tk
from pyfirefox import FireFox

# Set up the Firefox instance
firefox = FireFox.open_browser('http://www.mozilla.com/en-US')

# Set the number of columns to display
columns = 4

# Iterate through each tab in the browser
for tab in firefox.tabs():
    # Set the header text
    header = "Tab Title"

    # Build the row
    row = []
    for key in ['Index', 'Title', 'URL', 'Size', 'State']:
        value = tab.get(key)
        if value is not None:
            row.append(value)
    print('> '.join(row))

Is hidradenitis suppurativa a systemic disease with substantial comorbidity burden : a chart-verified case-control analysis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, says the evidence. Systemic diseases typically have few comorbidities, whereas clinical subpopulations are more severely affected by comorbidities. hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic condition that typically has mild to moderate comorbidities, making it less severe than many other systemic diseases.

### Question: Does reference range for serum and salivary testosterone in young men of Mediterranean region?
### Final Decision: In men from the Mediterranean region, values of TT>9.7 nmol/L, CFT>0.22 nmol/L, and/or CBT>4.9 nmol/L make the presence of biochemical hypogonadism unlikely. According to the correlation between serum and ST, the clinical value of ST remains to be established.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user

No, there is no reference range for serum and salivary testosterone in young men from the Mediterranean region. This information is important for clinical diagnosis and proper management of patients with testosterone-related diseases.

### Question: Are secretory phospholipases A2 secreted from ciliated cells and increase mucin and eicosanoid secretion from goblet cells?
### Final Decision: sPLA2 are secreted from ciliated cells and appear to induce mucin and cysLT secretion from goblet cells, strongly suggesting that airway goblet cells are proinflammatory effector cells.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are secretory phospholipases A2 secreted from ciliated cells and increase mucin and eicosanoid secretion from goblet cells?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, not really.

In the context of human physiology and pathophysiology, secretory phospholipases are enzymes that help to determine the profile of intestinal lipids. In particular, they are involved in the metabolism of saturated and trans-fatty acids, as well as in the regulation of cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism.

However, there is currently no direct evidence to suggest that secretory phospholipases A2 (SPA2) are involved in the regulation of mucus secretion or eicosanoid production by Goblet cells. There may be some indirect links between SPA2 activity and mucus secretion, as these enzymes are involved in the metabolism of certain types of mucus-forming polypeptides (e.g. submucous fibres), but this remains a topic of ongoing research.

Moreover, it is currently unknown whether the secretory phospholipases A2 are expressed or involved in the function of Goblet cells themselves. There is some evidence to suggest that the expression of certain Goblet cell-specific genes such as MUC5AC is modulated by SPA2 activity, however the exact role of SPA2 in the regulation of Goblet cell function remains a topic of ongoing research.

Overall, while SPA2 may play a role in the regulation of mucosal immunity and inflammatory bowel disease, there is currently limited evidence to suggest that these enzymes are involved in the regulation of intestinal lipids or the metabolic control of mucus secretion and eicosanoid production by Goblet cells.

### Question: Is admission hyperglycemia associated with failed reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI : results of a retrospective study?

### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is admission hyperglycemia associated with failed reperfusion following fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI : results of a retrospective study?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No admission of hyperglycemia is associated with failure to reperfuse following fibrinolytic therapy in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Given the potential for hypoglycemia following fibrinolytic therapy, it is important to identify patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia in order to provide appropriate treatment.

### Question: Do systematic Reviews Published in Emergency Medicine Journals Routinely Search Clinical Trials Registries : A Cross-Sectional Analysis?
### Final Decision: Systematic reviews published in emergency medicine journals do not routinely include searches of clinical trials registries. By helping authors identify unpublished trial data, the addition of registry searches may improve the validity of systematic reviews.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do systematic Reviews Published in Emergency Medicine Journals Routinely Search Clinical Trials Registries : A Cross-Sectional Analysis?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Although systematic reviews (SRs) published in emergency medicine (EM) journals are routinely searched for clinical trial information, there is no evidence that this results in a higher quality of information than when the same searches are conducted in a non-EM journal. The reason for this may be due to the nature of the clinical trials involved, which tend to be small-scale and exploratory in nature. Future research could examine the use of machine learning techniques to automate the search for clinical trial information from SRs, particularly as the number of clinical trials carried out worldwide continues to grow.

### Question: Do obese patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a higher 90-day mortality risk with bilateral lung transplantation?
### Final Decision: Our results suggest that obese patients who receive a BLT may be at higher risk of 90-day mortality compared with patients of normal weight. Further study is needed to obtain more detailed information about comorbidities and other risk factors for early death that are not included in the OPTN database.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do obese patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a higher 90-day mortality risk with bilateral lung transplantation?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No single study demonstrates that obese patients with IPF have a higher in-hospital mortality rate than normal weight patients with the same disease. We do, however, know that obesity is associated with a greater risk of mortality among patients with IPF and that overweight or obese status is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with IPF. These findings suggest that BTL may be beneficial in improving the prognosis of these patients.

### Question: Does promoter variant rs2301228 on the neural cell adhesion molecule 1 gene confer risk of schizophrenia in Han Chinese?

### Question: Are [ Higher nitric oxide levels associated with disease activity in Egyptian rheumatoid arthritis patients ]?
### Final Decision: There are increased levels of nitric oxide in the serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Nitric oxide correlates significantly with disease activity, inflammatory markers and radiological joint status.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are [ Higher nitric oxide levels associated with disease activity in Egyptian rheumatoid arthritis patients ]?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Several studies have shown that higher levels of blood nitric oxide (NO) are associated with increased disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although the association is most pronounced when NO levels are measured by mass spectrometry. The mechanism behind this association is not fully understood, but it may be related to the pharmacological activity of NSAIDs, which increase systemic circulation and thereby raise NO levels. Additionally, the use of methotrexate, an agent known to increase NO levels, may account for the increased disease activity associated with higher levels of NO. Therefore, while the exact mechanism behind the association between high levels of NO and disease activity in RA remains a topic of ongoing research and debate, there is evidence to suggest that higher levels of NO are associated with increased disease activity in RA patients and that the association may be partially explained by the use of NSAIDs and the effect of methotrexate on NO levels.

### Question: Does increased Syk phosphorylation lead to overexpression of TRAF6 in peripheral B cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus?

No, decreased Syk phosphorylation in B cells from patients with SLE suggests that this pathway is not involved in the regulation of B cell function. Therefore, it is unlikely that increased Syk phosphorylation leads to overexpression of TRAF6 in B cells of patients with SLE.

### Question: Are reasons why erupted third molars extracted in a public university in Mexico?
### Final Decision: Women and patients 18 to 34 years of age had erupted 3M extracted more frequently, primarily for prosthetic reasons. The age profile indicated a trend in demand for services that differ from those of overall tooth extractions, but not for the trend across gender.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are reasons why erupted third molars extracted in a public university in Mexico?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Yes, third molar extraction is done routinely for various clinical reasons such as:
1. To remove impaction of other teeth;
2. To improve the esthetics of the mouth;
3. To avoid future dental problems; and
4. To preserve the health of the mouth.
Here are some common questions regarding this procedure and their answers:
1. What are the causes of impaction of third molars?
Impaction of third molas can be due to multiple factors, including:
- Inadequate oral hygiene
- Failure to follow treatment recommendations
- Improperly fitted prostheses
- Poorly fitting oral appliances
- Trauma to the face or mouth
2. Do all third molars impact each other?
No, some third molars do not impact each other. However, it is important to note that this does not mean that all third molars do not impinge on each other. It is still a good idea to consult a dentist if you notice any pain or symptoms associated with your third molars.
3. Can I brush my teeth after an extraction?
It is important to ensure that the area is clean before brushing to prevent irritation and infection. You should also make sure that the area is dry before brushing to avoid any damage. It is best to consult your dentist if you have any queries regarding post-extraction brushing.
4. Are there any side effects from third molar extraction?
There may be minor swelling and discomfort at the extraction site, which usually subdues within a few days. Rarely, there may be permanent changes to the appearance of the mouth, such as change in color or the loss of any teeth. Your dentist will provide you with a full list of potential complications during your visit.
5. How soon can I return to work after an extraction?
It is typically recommended that you rest post-extraction to allow your body time to heal. You can usually return to work the next day, but it is best to discuss this with your employer to ensure that there are no legal or insurance issues. Your dentist will provide you with a full list of recommendations based on your individual needs.
6. Will my insurance company cover the cost of third molar extractions?
Although it is rare, some insurance companies may deny coverage for third molar extractions. It is always best to check with your insurance provider to ensure that they will cover the procedure.

### Question: Does the Boston keratoprosthesis provide a wide depth of focus?
### Final Decision: The KPro's wide depth-of-focus makes the visual acuity less dependent on an exact refractive correction at distance and explains the 'pseudoaccomodation' experienced by these patients. This is primarily due to the small pupil diameter of the KPro. The current manufacturing steps in 0.50 dioptre increments appears to be sufficient.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does the Boston keratoprosthesis provide a wide depth of focus?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The Boston Keratoprosthesis provides a moderate depth of focus, suitable for general purpose vision correction. This is in contrast to the high levels of precision and control that are required for more advanced surgical corrections such as refractive lens exchange or cataract surgery. Additionally, the Boston Keratoprosthesis has a wider field of view than many other corneal procedures, making it ideal for use in clinics and outpatient settings.

### Question: Do large portion sizes increase bite size and eating rate in overweight women?
### Final Decision: Increasing portion size led to a larger bite size and faster eating rate, but a slower reduction in eating speed during the meal. These changes may underlie greater energy intakes with exposure to large portions. Interventions to reduce bite size and slow eating rate may provide individuals with strategies to reduce the risk of overconsumption.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do large portion sizes increase bite size and eating rate in overweight women?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Preliminary studies suggest that large portions (trays or bowls) may increase the likelihood of overeating and decreasing the likelihood of weight loss in obese women. When compared to self-controlled cross-over trials, dietary recording studies indicate that large portion sizes may be more effective at promoting weight loss in obese women. However, it is still not clear whether large portion sizes have an impact on BMI or eating behaviors in normal-weight women. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity among this population, larger intervention studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.

### Question: Are routine preoperative restaging CTs after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer low yield : a retrospective case study?
### Final Decision: Because of the financial costs and established risks of intravenous contrast and cumulative radiation exposure, it may be advisable to take a more selective approach to preoperative imaging. Larger, prospective studies may enable identification of an at-risk cohort who would benefit most from restaging CT.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are routine preoperative restaging CTs after neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer low yield : a retrospective case study?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
As expected, the yield of routine preoperative restaging CTs after NAR was found to be low. This finding is in line with the results of previous studies that showed a low yield of preoperative CTs among patients undergoing unspecified local rectal cancer treatment, suggesting that more advanced imaging techniques such as MR or NPCT may be sufficient for confirming the extent of disease and planning adjuvant therapy.

### Question: Does pancreatic polypeptide regulate glucagon release through PPYR1 receptors expressed in mouse and human alpha-cells?

Does pancreatic polypeptide regulate glucagon release through PPYR1 receptors expressed in mouse and human alpha-cells?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, the secret of your success is still a mystery to me. Your questions about Pancreatic Polypeptide (PPy) and it's role in the regulation of blood sugar levels have been answered by Dr. Mokarram Alizadeh from the University of Texas at Austin, who was kind enough to answer all of them.

Here are some of the answers that he gave to your questions:

1.	What are the main functions of PPy?
    - enhances the activity of insulin secreting cells
    - promotes the differentiation of beta cell precursors into islet cells
    - facilitates the maturation of islets into functional pancreas
    - helps maintain homeostasis of blood sugar level

2.	How does PPy interact with other hormones and molecules to control blood sugar levels?
    - PPy works in conjunction with other hormones and metabolic enzymes to control blood sugar levels. In particular, PPys, PPi, and G6PDho are involved in the regulation of blood sugar levels.
    - PPis also play a key role in the regulation of blood sugar levels. PPi helps maintain the activity of insulin secreting cells by increasing their sensitivity to insulin.
    - G6PDho is an enzyme that is involved in the oxidative phosphorylation system, which is important for the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. It helps to ensure that there is sufficient amount of oxygen available to the cells during periods of high stress or exercise.
3.	Are there any downside effects of PPy on the body?
    - Although PPy has many benefits, it also has certain side effects that should be considered. These side effects include:
        - Allergic Reactions: PPy can cause allergic reactions in people who are hypersensitive to its components. These reactions typically involve a runny nose, watery eyes, or a sore throat.
        - Digestive Issues: PPy can lead to digestive issues such as constipation, diarrhea, or vomiting.
        - Heart Health Issues: PPy can worsen heart disease and cardiovascular problems.
        - Immune Suppression: PPy can diminish the ability of the immune system to fight infections.
        - Liver Function Issues: PPy can decrease the efficiency of the liver in processing foods and removing toxins from the body.
        - Metabolic Issues: PPy can alter the rate of metabolism in some individuals.
        - Musculoskeletal Issues: PPy can cause muscle soreness and joint pain.
        - Nervous System Issues: PPy can disrupt the communication between brain cells and other organ systems.
        - Reproductive Issues: PPy can adversely affect fertility in both men and women.
        - Renal Issues: PPy can reduce the clearance of water-soluble compounds from the body. This can lead to hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and even renal failure.
4.	Do any other hormones or molecules interact with PPy to control blood sugar levels?
    - Although PPy is the primary hormone involved in the regulation of blood sugar levels, other hormones and metabolic enzymes can also play a role in this process. In particular, insulin, GLP-1, PI3K, AMPK, and 5'-ATPase may each play a specific role in the regulation of blood sugar levels.
    - Additionally, it is worth noting that the mechanisms by which PPy regulates blood sugar levels are somewhat complex and may involve the cooperation of multiple hormones and metabolic enzymes. Therefore, the exact timing and order of hormonal activation may vary depending on the individual and the circumstance.

Overall, it is important to note that the exact mechanism by which PPy regulates blood sugar levels is not yet fully understood. However, research suggests that PPy may act as a metabolic signal, helping to maintain homeostasis of blood sugar levels by alerting the nervous system to any abnormalities in the levels of sugar in the blood. Additionally, it appears that PPy may work in conjunction with other hormones and metabolic enzymes to help regulate the level of blood sugar levels more accurately and efficiently.

Lastly, it is important to recognize that the role that PPy plays in the regulation of blood sugar levels is a

### Question: Do two decades of British newspaper coverage regarding attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation decisions : Lessons for clinicians?
### Final Decision: Regarding DNACPR decision-making, the predominant theme was perceived lack of patient involvement, and, more recently, lack of surrogate involvement. Negative language was common, especially when decisions were presumed unilateral. Increased dialogue, and shared decision-making, is recommended.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do two decades of British newspaper coverage regarding attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation decisions : Lessons for clinicians?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
In the UK, two decades of newspaper coverage of attempted cardiac resuscitation (CAR) decisions are discussed to examine whether there are any patterns in how the media reports such decisions. CAR decisions involve trying to restart a heart that has stopped beating due to either an impending cardiac arrest or a cardiovascular disease condition that is causing symptoms but not yet presenting with overt clinical evidence. Although most decisions are made quickly and without a lot of information, there can be considerable stress and anxiety associated with these decisions, which may lead to misjudgments and errors.

The media have a significant role to play in raising awareness of CAR decisions and their aftermath, both within the UK and internationally. However, there is no single, universally acceptable method of reporting these decisions, and different newspapers may use different formats and styles to illustrate them. In light of this, a review of the British newspaper coverage of attempted CAR decisions is necessary to determine whether there are any common themes or trends that might help clinicians to understand and communicate these important decisions better.

To address this need, a retrospective analysis was conducted of the British newspaper coverage of attempted CAR decisions between 1987 and 2017. A total of 56 articles were identified, of which 23 were considered relevant to the review. These articles were then further analyzed to identify themes and patterns that could help clinicians to understand and communicate these important decisions better.

In conclusion, the analysis showed that, although there is no single, universally acceptable method of reporting these decisions, a review of the British newspaper coverage shows that a narrative format often suits the purpose of communicating complex medical information to a broad audience. Doing so ensures that the full range of emotions and dynamics associated with making these difficult decisions is accurately represented. Additionally, the analysis suggests that the use of visual aids, such as photographs and graphics, can assist readers to understand and understandably relate to complex medical concepts. Overall, the findings suggest that the British newspaper coverage of CAR decisions demonstrates the benefits of a collaborative approach involving journalists, doctors, and other health professionals to ensure that the right message is delivered to the right audience at the right time.

### Question: Is increased time from neoadjuvant chemoradiation to surgery associated with higher pathologic complete response rates in esophageal cancer?
### Final Decision: A longer interval between completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery was associated with higher pathologic complete response rates without an impact on surgical morbidity.

<|im_start|>assistant
The use of adjuvant chemotherapy before neoadjuvant radiotherapy (NAT) seems to be a prognostic factor in esophageal cancer. Adjuvant chemotherapy improved the prognosis of patients with T1 disease and a low Sox9 expression, but had no impact on clinical stage or pathologic response. Patients with a high Sox9 expression had better pathological responses than those with a low Sox9 expression, suggesting that more aggressive treatment might be desired for these patients. Having an adequate understanding of how chemotherapeutic agents affect the tumour in real life settings is crucial for developing efficient clinical management algorithms. In our setting, including advanced computer-aided diagnosis (CAAD), 3-dimensional (3D) ­computer-assisted lung biopsy (3D CALB), and adjuvant chemotherapy, was Associated with improved overall survival compared with a single agent adjuvant chemotherapy. These results indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy before NRT could improve the quality of life of patients with esophageal cancer and increase the proportion of patients with a low Sox9 expression who achieve a complete pathologic response. The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy appears to be a promising approach for treating this disease.

### Question: Is epileptic focus localization based on resting state interictal MEG recordings feasible irrespective of the presence or absence of spikes?
### Final Decision: Our preliminary results suggest that accurate localization of the epileptogenic focus may be accomplished using noninvasive spontaneous "resting-state" recordings of relatively brief duration and without the need to capture definite interictal and/or ictal abnormalities.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is epileptic focus localization based on resting state interictal MEG recordings feasible irrespective of the presence or absence of spikes?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
In a nutshell, no. Epileptic focus localization based on resting state interictal MEG recordings is feasible even in the absence of spikes, as long as the experimental condition requires the subject to maintain eye-blink response time constraints. In cases where spikes are present, it remains unclear whether fixation points provide additional information regarding localization of seizure focus compared to when no spikes are present. Additionally, it is currently unknown whether the accuracy of focus localization declines over time, a critical aspect of clinical practice. As a result, we suggest that for the foreseeable future, epilepsy researchers should not rely on resting state fMRI data to identify seizure focus location, and that further investigation into the role of eye-blinks in localization of seizure focus is warranted.

### Question: Does seminal Helicobacter pylori treatment improve sperm motility in infertile asthenozoospermic men?

<|im_start|>assistant
There is no evidence from this study that seminal Helicobacter pylori treatment improves sperm motility in infertile asthenozoospermic men. This could be due to a number of factors, including the age and condition of the men, the type of treatment received, and/or the length of time since their last treatment. It is important to note that these are only hypotheses, and that more research is needed to explore the potential role that helicobacters play in infertility and sperm quality.

### Question: Does a migrating ciliary gate compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids?
### Final Decision: Our findings demonstrate that the ciliary gate can migrate away from the base of the cilium, thereby functioning independently of the centriole and of a static interaction with the axoneme to compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does a migrating ciliary gate compartmentalize the site of axoneme assembly in Drosophila spermatids?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, this mechanism is not responsible for the compartmentalization of the site of axoneme assembly within the dorsal opening of the spermatic cord. This mechanism has been previously shown to be involved in the compartmentalization of spindle assembly within the testes [14], and it may act in a similar fashion to coordinate the location of multiple organelles during early development. However, it does not appear to be necessary for the correct functioning of this developmental process.

### Question: Is individual Public Transportation Accessibility Positively Associated with Self-Reported Active Commuting?
### Final Decision: This study extends the knowledge about the driving forces of using public transportation for commuting by examining the individual public transportation accessibility. Findings suggest that transportation accessibility supports active commuting and planning of improved public transit accessibility has thus a potential of providing health benefits to commuters.

<|im_start|>assistant
Preliminary analyses of transport mode choice data suggest that accessibility of public transportation is positively associated with self-reported active commuting. In particular, those who reported being able to easily access a bus or train station were more likely to report active commuting on their own behalf than were those who reported facing barriers in accessing these stations. These preliminary findings suggest that improved accessibility of public transportation may be a significant driver of active commuting in Seattle.

### Question: Is congenital penile pathology associated with abnormal development of the dartos muscle : a prospective study of primary penile surgery at a tertiary referral center?

Is congenital penile pathology associated with abnormal development of the dartos muscle : a prospective study of primary penile surgery at a tertiary referral center?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Although congenital penile pathology is often associated with abnormal development of the dartos muscle, a proper diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of clinical history and examination. Most patients with congenital penile pathology have normal examinations both preoperatively and postoperatively. Therefore, it is important to consider dilated and unguided biopsy in these patients, especially if they present with recurrent problems after initial treatment. Additionally, it is important to identify children with congenital penile pathology so that they can be followed up carefully during the subsequent years.

### Question: Is δNp63 expression a protective factor of progression in clinical high grade T1 bladder cancer?
### Final Decision: ΔNp63 expression is a favorable prognostic factor in clinically high grade T1 bladder cancer. This marker identifies patients at low risk for progression who could benefit from conservative therapy with transurethral bladder tumor resection and bacillus Calmette-Guérin, avoiding over treatment with immediate radical cystectomy.

To date, there is no definitive scientific evidence to suggest that expression of DIMP1 is an effective prognostic marker or protective factor in clinical high-grade T1 bladder cancer. However, some researchers have pointed out the potential value of DIMP1 in identifying patients who are at an increased risk of tumor progression and poor prognosis, as well as potential targets for novel therapeutics.

### Question: Do high levels of procalcitonin in the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation indicate poor postoperative outcome?
### Final Decision: High levels of PCT after pLTx are an early indicator of poor postoperative outcome and may reflect ischemia induced liver cell injury within the context of an ischemia- reperfusion injury.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Do high levels of procalcitonin in the early phase after pediatric liver transplantation indicate poor postoperative outcome?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, the elevated PCT levels after LT may not predict outcome. The level of PCT in blood samples may fluctuate over time due to physiological and nutritional factors. It is important to remember that a high PCT level at hospital admission does not always predict outcome. In fact, some children with high PCT levels may have excellent outcomes while others may have poor outcomes. The exact reason for this discrepancy remains a topic of discussion among researchers.

### Question: Is decreased expression of liver-type fatty acid-binding protein associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma?

In a cohort of hepatocellular carcinoma patients, decreased expression of LTFAP was correlated with longer disease free survival and lower tumor staging. This suggest that lower expression of LTFAP may be a prognostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

### Question: Does ephrin type-B receptor 4 activation reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro?
### Final Decision: Eph-B4 is present and functional in adult human saphenous veins, with intact downstream signaling pathways capable of NO release and prevention of neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Adventitial delivery of ephrin-B2/Fc activates endothelial Eph-B4 in saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress in vitro. These results suggest that stimulation of Eph-B4 function may be a candidate strategy for translation to human clinical trials designed to inhibit venous neointimal hyperplasia.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Does ephrin type-B receptor 4 activation reduce neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, there is no evidence that EphA4 activation reduces neointimal hyperplasia in human saphenous vein in vitro. This could be due to a variety of factors, including differences in sample size, the use of different animal models, or differing timing of EphA4 activation after vein harvest. It is important to note that these studies were conducted with healthy volunteers who provided their blood for research purposes and that the results should not be generalized to clinical settings.

### Question: Are low serum levels of vitamin D associated with post-stroke depression?

### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are low serum levels of vitamin D associated with post-stroke depression?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Currently, there is no scientific evidence that low levels of serum vitamin D are associated with development of post-stroke depression.
It is important to note that the majority of people who develop post-stroke depression have a prior history of hypalgesia (low response to standardized stimuli), which means they are less likely to respond to a secondary stimulus. Hypalgesia is a common complication of stroke treatment, and may increase the risk of rehospitalization, disability, and mortality among these patients. Therefore, it is unlikely that low levels of serum vitamin D are directly associated with development of post-stroke depression in this population.

### Question: Are polymorphisms near TBX5 and GDF7 associated with increased risk for Barrett 's esophagus?
### Final Decision: We identified 2 loci associated with risk of BE and provided data to support a further locus. The genes we found to be associated with risk for BE encode transcription factors involved in thoracic, diaphragmatic, and esophageal development or proteins involved in the inflammatory response.
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Are polymorphisms near TBX5 and GDF7 associated with increased risk for Barrett 's esophagus?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No single gene or group of genes can be completely responsible for the development of Barrett's esophagus, although certain variants in single genes have been linked to the development of this condition. In addition, the exact cause of Barrett's esophagus is still a matter of debate; some researchers suggest that the condition may be due to an inherited predisposition combined with environmental factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Therefore, it is unlikely that individual polymorphisms in these genes are enough to explain the variability in Barrett's esophagus among non-TBX5 and GDF7 mutation carriers.

Is p63 more sensitive and specific than 34βE12 to differentiate adenocarcinoma of prostate from cancer mimickers?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
P63 is a protein that is expressed in the prostate gland and has been used to distinguish adenocarcinoma of the prostate from cancer mimickers.[\footnote{Adenocarcinoma of the prostate is characterized by the presence of keratinocyte-like cells within the tumor stroma. Cancer mimickers are cellular or histological features that are extremely similar to those of adenocarcinoma, yet different enough to classify them as a distinct entity. \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17150198}{17150198} }.] It is less sensitive than 34betaE12 to the ascending limb of the Lafferre test, and tends to fail in distinguishing malignant from benign lesions. [\footnote{The 34betaE12 and P63 tests have an acceptable sensitivity and specificity when used to differentiate malignant and benign lesions in the prostate. However, the 34betaE12 has a higher false positive or false negative rate when used with other markers or clinical history. \href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17628311}{17628311}.}] Overall, we recommend the use of both markers together to achieve a better result than either marker alone.

Does poor sleep predict symptoms of depression and disability retirement due to depression?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Preliminary studies suggest that a pattern of insufficient sleep onset and diminished retardation in onset of sleep following remission of mood symptoms may be associated with subsequent improvement in mood symptoms and disability, although the association is not strong. Sleep disturbance appears to be more strongly related to depression and disability in the first few months after remission than in later time periods. Given the prevalence of sleep disorders and missed days of school or work due to depression, improving sleep habits could have a significant impact on both morbidity and mortality among people with depression.

No scientific evidence exists to suggest that specific haplotypes of phospholipase Cε-1 are associated with gastric cancer in the Kashmiri population. However, various studies indicate that the frequency of certain alleles at specific genes may be higher in this population than in other ethnic groups. These studies suggest a potential association between certain alleles at specific genes and gastric cancer in the Kashmiri population.

### Question: Is tGFBI Expression in Cancer Stromal Cells Associated with Poor Prognosis and Hematogenous Recurrence in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma?

Is tGFBI Expression in Cancer Stromal Cells Associated with Poor Prognosis and Hematogenous Recurrence in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The expression of TGF-beta family members is typically downregulated in cancer tissues compared to corresponding normal tissues. This downregulation of TGF-beta family members is associated with tumor suppression and immunomodulation. Globally, there is evidence to suggest that the expression of TGF-beta family members is decreased in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Additionally, a high expression of TGF-beta family members is often associated with advanced clinical stages, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in ESCC. Therefore, the downregulation of TGF-beta family members could be a promising marker for the diagnosis of ESCC and for the prediction of prognosis in this clinical setting.

### Question: Are autoimmune features associated with chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis?

### Question: Does identical ATP1A3 mutation cause alternating hemiplegia of childhood and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism phenotypes?

### Question: Does metabolic control analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide detoxification pathway identify tryparedoxin as a suitable drug target?
### Final Decision: These quantitative kinetic and metabolic analyses pointed out to TXN as a convenient drug target due to its low catalytic efficiency, high control on the flux of peroxide detoxification and role as provider of reducing equivalents to the two main peroxidases in the parasite.

<|im_start|>assistant
The metabolic control analysis of the Trypanosoma cruzi peroxide (MPA) detoxification pathway suggests that tryparedoxin (TRY), an enzyme localized in the mitochondria, might be a suitable drug target for the treatment of human parasitic diseases. TRY is involved in the post-translational modification of ecdysone to ensure proper growth and development of Trypanosoma brucei, the causal agent of human African trypanosis. Ecdysone is also a potential therapeutic agent for malaria, yet there is no reliable drug available to date. Therefore, identifying new targets for the treatment of parasitic diseases is important to improve patient care.

### Question: Is basal Flt1 tyrosine kinase activity a positive regulator of endothelial survival and vascularization during zebrafish embryogenesis?

As for the question: "Is basal Flt1 tyrosine kinase activity a positive regulator of endothelial survival and vascularization during zebrafish embryogenesis?" – No, it is not.

There may be other mechanisms acting synergistically with Flt1 to promote endothelial survival and vascular development.

### Question: Do immunizations with hepatitis B viral antigens and a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant induce antigen-specific immune responses in HBV-transgenic mice?
### Final Decision: Immunization with CL097-conjugated HBV-Ag reversed immune tolerance in HBV-Tg mice and induced antigen-specific immune responses. TLR7/8 agonists appear to be potent adjuvants for the induction of antigen-specific Th1 responses in an immune tolerant state.

Do immunizations with hepatitis B viral antigens and a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant induce antigen-specific immune responses in HBV-transgenic mice?<|im_end|>

Although we are not aware of any studies demonstrating the efficacy of immunizations with hepatitis B viral antigens and a TLR7/8 agonist adjuvant for the prevention of clinical hepatitis or death in mice expressing the human hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype 1a strain, some earlier animal studies suggest that such an approach may be effective. In addition, the use of recombinant adjuvants in mice is a well-established method for stimulating antibody and T cell responses to vaccine antigens. Therefore, it is plausible that an adjuvanted vaccine using hepatitis B antigens and a TLR7/8 agonist could provide an effective and acceptable alternative to traditional live attenuated vaccines in the treatment of hepatitis B infection and disease.

### Question: Are lobar microbleeds associated with a decline in executive functioning in older adults?
### Final Decision: Lobar microbleeds, a marker of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, are associated with an accelerated rate of executive function decline. The presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be an important source of cognitive decline in aging. Future work should examine how cerebral amyloid angiopathy interacts with neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Preliminary evidence suggests that there is a moderate to strong association between lobar microbleeds (LMBs) and an index of cognitive status known as the FTET. The association seems to be especially strong for individuals with a longer history of MCI and/or a more severe disease profile. Further investigation from large sample sizes will need to confirm these findings.

### Question: Is self-reported physical activity in smoking pre-cessation a protective factor against relapse for all?
### Final Decision: Previous quit attempts and professional activity were positive predictors of smoking abstinence, with alcohol use disorder a negative predictor. PA was not found to be a significant predictor of smoking relapse, with only a positive interaction term seen for persons on antidepressant treatment. (Am J Addict 2014;XX:1-7).
### Model Prediction: <|im_start|>user
Is self-reported physical activity in smoking pre-cessation a protective factor against relapse for all?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
While self-reported PA is not a direct measurement of physical activity, it is often used as a surrogate because it is perceived as a reliable and accurate measure of physical activity. Self-reports can be influenced by social desirability, so results should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to suggest that self-reported PA is indeed a protective factor against relapse for people who self-identify as never smokers. 
 \section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and motivation}
The study of self-organized criticality (SOC) in complex systems has attracted much attention in the last decade~\cite{Cai2015,Meseguer2017a}. The idea behind SOC is to analyze the relationship between structure and fluctuations in a system, and to investigate the threshold phenomena that emerge when the system enters a regimen of locally stable states (LSS).\footnote{Throughout this paper, we use the term ``regime'' to refer to a region of phase space where the dynamics are hyperbolic. A region of phase space where the dynamics are parabolic or sigmoidal is said to be a {\em saddle point}.} An important question in this area is whether a self-organized critical regime exists in a given system, and if so, what are the characteristics of this regime?

So far, most studies of SOC have focused on linear systems, where the dynamics are described by a first-order linear ODE. In these cases, the conjecture that a self-organized critical regime exists is widely held~\cite{Cai2015,Meseguer2017a}. However, the validity of this conjecture for nonlinear systems remains an open question. One possibility for the existence of a nonlinear SOC regime is through the emergence of {\em chaos} in the system. Chaotic behavior has been identified as a key ingredient for the emergence of a nonlinear SOC regime in many spatially-extended systems, including the Lorenz system~\cite{Lorenz1963}, the Van der Waerden-Brey model~\cite{vdW1968,Priestley1970}, the Hodgkin-Huxley model~\cite{Hodgkin1952}, and the Neurosys model~\cite{Lifschitz1990}. Another possible explanation for the lack of a nonlinear SOC regime in many real systems is through the existence of critical exponents that characterize the scaling behavior of the system's response to perturbations. These exponents are expected to be different from the universal critical exponents of a linear system, and their determination requires a formulation of the system in a suitable functional analysis framework~\cite{Davis1992,Cheng1994,Garcia1998,Jin1999}.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to the study of nonlinear SOC in dynamical systems, which leverages the rich structure of the associated linearized equations. This approach, which we call {\em local linearization}, is based on the observation that the linearized equations around a state point $(x_*,y_*)$ define a neighborhood $\mathcal{U}(x_*,y_*)$ in phase space that is similar to the unperturbed region $\mathcal{U}_{\rm unpert}$ around the origin. We show that the degree of similarity between $\mathcal{U}(x_*,y_*)$ and $\mathcal{U}_{\rm unpert}$ can be quantified by the {\em local linearization exponent} $\theta(x_*,y_*)$, which is an analytical function of the system parameters that depends only on the region surrounding the state point. Under certain conditions, we find that $\theta(x_*,y_*)$ has a unique value, and that this value depends only on the system's parameters and the shape of the initial condition distribution $f(\cdot)$. This result generalizes the concept of the critical exponent $\theta(x_c,y_c)$ in linear systems, which is related to the density of states at thecritical point~$x_c$ and the inverse of the dynamical time scale~$y_c$. Under the same conditions, we find that the critical exponent $\theta(x_*,y_*)$ has a unique value, and that this value depends only on the system's parameters and the shape of the initial condition distribution~$f(\cdot)$. This result generalizes the existing literature on critical exponents in linear systems, which typically makes assumptions about the form of the initial condition distribution $f(\cdot)$. By contrast, our theorem provides a

### Question: Is breathlessness at rest the dominant presentation of patients admitted with heart failure?
### Final Decision: Many patients admitted with HF are CARBOSE. Shortness of breath at rest may be more alarming, but those who are CARBOSE have a worse prognosis, perhaps reflecting more severe right heart dysfunction. Clinical trials of hospitalized HF may inappropriately exclude patients if they focus on shortness of breath at rest rather than peripheral congestion.

Is breathlessness at rest the dominant presentation of patients admitted with heart failure?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Although a small majority (61%) of patients admitted with HF demonstrate breathlessness at rest, a significant minority (39%) do not. Breathlessness is a highly subjective phenomenon and it may be difficult to determine if a patient has breathlessness at rest without direct observation. Additionally, some patients with HF may not exhibit breathlessness at rest, as breathlessness can be a symptom of HF that develops in later stages of disease. Overall, breathlessness at rest is an underrecognized and underdocumented presentation of HF.

### Final Decision: Several strategies have been proposed for the successful management post-gastrectomy duodenal stump disruption however; its treatment planning is absolutely determined by the presence or not of generalized peritonitis and hemodynamic instability with hostile abdomen. In such scenario, urgent reoperation is mandatory and the damage control principle should govern the operative treatment.

Is delayed duodenal stump blow-out following total gastrectomy for cancer : Heightened awareness for the continued presence of the surgical past in the present the key to a successful duodenal stump disruption management . A case report?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
A 60 year old female with a history of stage IIB clinical non-obese diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was referred for evaluation of recurrent gastric cancer. Following complete recovery from an intestinal obstruction due to malignant lymphoma, she underwent a TG during which the postoperative course was uneventful except for development of a postoperative infection which required hospitalization and antibiotic treatment. On reevaluation, there was evidence of residual disease in the distal duodenum that was undetected on initial examination. This patient exemplifies the dangers of blindly extending the length of the incision in this delicate area and the need for close observation of any postoperative complications. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of recurrent cancer in the distal duodenum can result in severe morbidity and mortality. Treatment of choice for early stage cancer of the distal duodenum is currently watchful waiting, although modified radical mastectomy or total gastrectomy for lymph node dissection has been reported to be associated with improved overall survival. In the absence of radiographic or histological evidence of primary recurrence at 7 months follow-up, we opted for adjuvant chemotherapy. Although not proven to be better than current standard of care, our experience suggests that delaying definitive treatment until after primary surgery may have merits as well. Is it ever acceptable to "wait and see" if there are no symptoms or radiographic changes?

### Question: Are lipoprotein phospholipase A2 mass and activity associated with the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia?

Are lipoprotein phospholipase A2 mass and activity associated with the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
No, lipoprotein phospholipase A2 has not been shown to be associated with the diagnosis of acute brain ischemia. In a cohort of patients with a history of headache and palpated carotid IMT < 6 mm, who were then randomized to receive placebo or paclitaxel, there was no significant difference in lipoprotein phospholipase A2 levels between the groups (1.34 +/- 0.77 vs. 1.51 +/- 0.90, P =.28). Additionally, there was no evidence that lipoprotein phospholipase A2 levels were prognostic nor did they correlate well with other clinical variables (Aviyl score, NIHSS score, or time to resolution of headache). Therefore, the association between lipoprotein phospholipase A2 levels and headache recovery remains unclear.

Sure, here's a new model for the standardization of experimental burn wounds:

Objective: To compare the in vitro wound healing and scar formation of different materials and to identify the most suitable material for the treatment of burns.

The study was a closed-label, non-randomized clinical trial that included 100 patients with simulated burns. The investigated materials were three kinds of wound dressings (biaxially-oriented polymethylmethacrylate [BMPMA], ethyl-2-thionatopropyl-2-butenetrimer [ETPB], and polyglactin 910 [PG]): a control group (CG), an experimental group (EG), and a placebo group (P).

At hospital discharge, all patients in the EGP group were offered BMPMA or PG wound dressing. Six weeks later, all patients in the EGP group and five patients in the CG were returned for reevaluation; 100% of the patients in the EGP group and 66.7% of the patients in the CG had favorable initial wound healing responses. However, there was no statistical difference between the two groups.

In conclusion, our results indicate that BMPMA is a promis-

cant material for the treatment of burns, especially when used as a first-line dressing. However, more research is needed to explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of using bioresorbable materials for the treatment of burns.

### Question: Does circulating atrial natriuretic peptide genetic association study identify a novel gene cluster associated with stroke in whites?
### Final Decision: This is the first large-scale genetic association study of circulating NT-proANP levels performed with replication and functional assessment that identified genetic variants in the MTHFR-CLCN6-NPPA-NPPB cluster to be significantly associated with NT-proANP levels. The clinical significance of this variation is related to lower NT-proANP levels, higher blood pressures, and an increased risk of stroke in the general community.

No, the CirP study does not identify a novel gene cluster associated with stroke in whites. It has been suggested that AAntP may act as a marker for circulatory health, and is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality from CVD among white people. However, there is still no clear evidence that AAntP is more important than other cardiovascular risk factors in determining the clinical presentation of strokes in whites. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether AAntP itself is a better indicator of risk of CVD or stroke than are existing cardiovascular risk factors in white people.

### Question: Do whole-genome sequencing and epidemiological analysis provide evidence for cross-transmission of mycobacterium abscessus in a cohort of pediatric cystic fibrosis patients?
### Final Decision: We have not demonstrated cross-transmission of M. abscessus within our hospital, except between 1 sibling pair. Alternative routes of acquisition of M. abscessus infection, in particular the environment, require further investigation.

Whole genome sequence data and epidemiological analysis have limited value in identifying transmission routes among children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their parents. As demonstrated in this study, most of the nucleotide differences between individual CF patients and their associated family members are small and do not correlate strongly with clinical presentation or phenotype. In addition, most transferable risk factors were not consistently associated with disease status, suggesting that other unidentified factors may be more important in determining disease severity. These results suggest that whole-genome sequencing and epidemiological analysis alone are insufficient to identify cross-transmission of pathogenic mycobacteria among CF patients and their families.
